To run the testers:
Extract tt.tar to a directory that contain your exercise files and run
perl runTestsForStudents.pl

The results will be in the created file res.txt. Two more files will be created:
1. log.txt -  a log of the tests.

2. stderr_re.txt - a file with the error messages created in the exercise and the status returned by the different tests.
