EX: 2

FILES: 
outputdevice.cpp -- the implementation of the library 
TaskList.h -- the definition of the data structure that contains all 
	the printing tasks
TaskList.cpp -- the implementation of the data structure that contains 
		all the printing tasks

REMARKS:
* The printing tasks are managed by the TaskList class. This class contains the queue of unprinted
tasks, keeps history of all tasks already printed, and allows access to the tasks by their ID.

* Each task contains a conditional variable that allows it to signal once it's printed 
(for flush2device purposes) and a mutex associated with it. In addition, all the internal
datastructures in TaskList is protected by a mutex. An additional mutex protects the 
initialization process.

ANSWERS:
Nothing was asked.
